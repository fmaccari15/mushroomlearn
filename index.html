    <p>I am a second-year Manufacturing and Design Engineering student at Northwestern University pursuing a minor in Art Theory and Practice. These areas challenge and complement each other, giving me the tools to trace product design, creative, communication, and geometry-oriented careers.</p>
    <p>My passions are also presented as a member of Mayfest Productions' Promotion Committee, the organization behind the nation’s largest student-run music festival, and as a member of NU BAJA SAE, a student team that designs and builds a car for off-road competitions. This winter, I am at San Francisco as a part of Northwestern’s Bay Area Immersion Program, delving more into the studies of the intersection of design and media innovation.</p>

    <p>This is a self-portrait I made in a drawing class. I used charcoal and drew it through a reductive method: I painted the whole canvas with charcoal and then erased the highlights</p>

    <h2 id="graphicdesigns-section"> Graphic designs </h2>
    <img src="design.png" style="height:450px" >
    <p>This is a different self-portrait. It is based on a game that says the first animals you think when asking yourself "What animal would you be if not a human?" represent your personality. These are mine.</p>
